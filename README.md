Welcome to the Java DSA world. Here are all the Data Structures and Algorithms you ever need to help you get prepared for your job interviews.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

    - printList()
    - getHead()
    - getTail()
    - getLength()
    - getLastValue()
    - append()
    - prepend()
    - removeFirst()
    - removeLast()
    - get()
    - set()
    - insert()
    - remove()
    - reverse()
    - findMiddleNode()
    - hasLoop()
    - removeDuplicates()
  - `doublyLinkedList`: the folder containing Doubly Linked List implementation

## Run locally
